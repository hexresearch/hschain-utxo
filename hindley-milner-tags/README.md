# Type inference for functional programming languages 

## Introduction

The algorithm implementation is taken from the book 
"The implementation of functional programming languages" by Simon L. Peyton Jones.
We can type-check polymorphic lambda-functions with it.
The algorithm is augmented with generic source code locations and variable names.

It is generic in source code locations and variable names. Note that if you don't
need to use source code locations you can use type `()` for it.
